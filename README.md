# angular-movie-search

This is a relatively straight-forward exercise in coding with AngularJS.

(Note: Display of poster images on Detail view works fine when running from a localhost environment, but results in 403 errors in a hosted environment, due to IMDB's policy against hotlinking.)

## Features

- single page application architecture
- queries and returns data from the OMDB API


## TODO

- use localStorage to keep/display search history
- lose the hashbang with html5mode
- return more data to detail view
- use $resource to handle API queries
- improve error handling
- search by type (movie/tv)
- integrate additional APIs (Amazon? Wikipedia?)
- add some fun animations
