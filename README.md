# angular-movie-search

This is a relatively straight-forward exercise in coding with AngularJS.

## Features

- single page application architecture
- queries and returns data from the OMDB API


## TODO

- use localStorage to keep/display search history
- improve error handling
- search by type (movie/tv)
- integrate additional APIs (Amazon? Wikipedia?)
- add some fun animations
